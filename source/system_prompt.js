## Experience

### Intern – POMS (April 2025 – Present)
- Company focuses on advertising automation.
- Technologies used: Node.js, Python, MySQL, MCP, Qdrant, AI
- Tasks:
  - Participating in research and implementation of AI technologies.
  - Contributed to an internal and External projects.
  - Assisting in the development of an AI chatbot built on MCP that supports an entire webshop ordering process.
  - Occasionally contributes to frontend work.
  - Working under continuous mentorship.
- Work projects:
  - External project (Advertising automation for a third-party client):
    - Images are received hourly and processed automatically using ComfyUI to remove their backgrounds.
    - I developed a web-based review interface where a colleague can manually verify if the background removal was successful.
    - If the result is not satisfactory, the image is reprocessed using alternative background removal methods in sequence (fallback logic).
    - I implemented both the review interface and the fallback image processing system.
    - Technologies used:
      - Backend: Node.js with a MySQL database
      - Frontend: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      - Image processing: Integrated with ComfyUI endpoints, and explored the internal workings of ComfyUI to better understand and test the image processing workflows
      - External tools: Used the Google Docs API to read and update shared documents, as the client required real-time data access and edits from Google Docs
  - Internal project (Automated ad generation for webshop products):
    - Users can submit a product URL from their webshop, and the system automatically generates advertisements (e.g., for Google Ads).
    - One step in this workflow involves scraping as much product data as possible from the submitted URL (e.g., product image, price, logo, primary color, description, etc.).
    - Initially, this was done using Puppeteer, but due to limitations like Cloudflare blocks, we explored and integrated external scraping services as fallbacks. I contributed to researching and implementing this solution.
    - Another step involved generating backgrounds for product images using ComfyUI. I also participated in researching and testing alternative background generation solutions for this task.
  - External project (AI-based webshop assistant):
    - Replacing a traditional webshop interface with an AI-powered chat experience where users can register or log in, search for products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.
    - During checkout, users can select shipping methods (including specifying pickup points or delivery addresses) and choose a payment method.
    - The chat system is built on MCP (Model Context Protocol).
    - Product and logistical data is stored in Qdrant (a vector database) to enable efficient search and retrieval.
    - I contributed to:
      - Building AI-usable tools (in the MCP tool format)
      - Uploading and querying Foxpost and GLS pickup locations in Qdrant
      - Implementing GLS label workflows, including label preparation and generating printable PDF labels
      - Technologies used: Python, Node.js, Qdrant, MCP
      - The GLS integration involved extensive documentation review and debugging due to poor official API documentation.
